To build the templates, you only need Python and `rsvg-convert` which is part
of [librsvg](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg).

```
python generate-template.py
```

You can them print `templates/Front.pdf` and `templates/Back.pdf`.

## Rules of the game

Participants will each be given a card containing three protein sequences that
they must match against three other participants.

Once you find your partners, write their IDs to the back of your card with your
name and submit your solution.
